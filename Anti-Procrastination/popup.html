<!-- how it is work


Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the Focus Mode extension works:

1. User clicks the extension icon:

When the user clicks the Focus Mode extension icon in the browser toolbar, the popup.html file is loaded in a new popup window.

2. User clicks the "Start Focus Mode" button:

When the user clicks the "Start Focus Mode" button, the startTimer() function is called. This function:

Hides the "Start Focus Mode" button and shows the "Stop Focus Mode" button.
Sets the timer text to the duration (e.g., 25 minutes).
Starts a timer using the setInterval() function, which decrements the timer every second.
3. Timer is running:

While the timer is running, the blockDistractingWebsites() function is called every time the user navigates to a new tab or updates an existing tab. This function:

Checks if the current tab is a distracting website (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) by checking the URL against the distractingWebsites array.
If the current tab is a distracting website, the function blocks the website by updating the tab's URL to Google.com (or any other website you want to redirect to).
4. User clicks the "Stop Focus Mode" button:

When the user clicks the "Stop Focus Mode" button, the stopTimer() function is called. This function:

Shows the "Start Focus Mode" button and hides the "Stop Focus Mode" button.
Resets the timer text to "00:00:00".
5. Timer expires:

When the timer expires (i.e., reaches 0), the stopTimer() function is called automatically, and the timer is reset.

How the extension interacts with the browser:

The extension uses the following browser APIs to interact with the browser:

chrome.tabs: This API allows the extension to interact with tabs, such as getting the current tab, updating the tab's URL, and listening for tab updates.
chrome.tabs.onUpdated: This event listener is used to listen for tab updates, such as when the user navigates to a new tab or updates an existing tab.
How the extension is packaged:

The extension is packaged as a .crx file, which contains the following files:

manifest.json: This file contains metadata about the extension, such as its name, version, and permissions.
popup.html: This file contains the HTML for the popup window.
styles.css: This file contains the CSS styles for the popup window.
script.js: This file contains the JavaScript code that runs in the popup window.
To load the extension in the browser, you need to go to chrome://extensions/, enable developer mode, and click "Load unpacked". Then, select the folder that contains the extension's files. -->
